# CommAI: Analyzing Human Communication Skills Through Text and Speech Interaction

CommAI is an innovative project designed to assess and enhance human communication skills by analyzing interactions through both text and speech. By leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool evaluates users' communication abilities across multiple parameters and provides actionable feedback.

# Features

Dual Interface: Users can interact with CommAI via text or speech input, making it versatile and accessible.

Comprehensive Evaluation Parameters: Communication skills are assessed on seven key aspects:

Clarity

Conciseness

Tone and Sentiment

Engagement

Grammar and Spelling

Vocabulary Usage

Persuasiveness

Level-Based Feedback: Based on the evaluation, users are categorized into three levels:

Poor

Intermediate

Excellent

Automatic Parameter Selection: The system dynamically selects parameters for evaluation, with JavaScript disabling manual user selection to ensure fairness and consistency.

Advanced AI Integration: CommAI uses the Ollama 3 model for text and speech analysis, ensuring robust and accurate evaluations.

# Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the user interface.

Backend: Python with Flask for server-side logic and integration.

AI and NLP: Leveraging TensorFlow and Ollama 3 for text and speech processing.

Database: MySQL for storing user data and evaluation results.

# How It Works

Input: Users provide input via text typing or speech recording.

Processing: The input is processed by AI models to extract relevant features.

Evaluation: Each parameter is scored based on the processed data.

Feedback: The system provides detailed feedback and assigns the user a communication skill level.

# Challenges and Solutions

Performance Issues: Due to hardware limitations (8 GB RAM), response times for text and speech analysis ranged from 2-3 minutes. This issue highlights the need for more efficient processing or hardware upgrades.

User Experience: A dynamic interface ensures that users receive a seamless and intuitive experience.

# Future Enhancements

Improved Hardware Support: Upgrading to better hardware to reduce response times.

Mobile Compatibility: Developing a mobile-friendly version of the application.

Gamification: Adding interactive activities to make learning communication skills more engaging.

Personalized Recommendations: Offering tailored suggestions for improvement based on user performance.
